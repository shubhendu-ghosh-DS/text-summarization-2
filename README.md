### **In this project we will be using a pretrained model to generate a summary from a big chunk of text.**
## Requirements
- [transformers](https://pytorch.org/hub/huggingface_pytorch-transformers/)
- os
## Transformers
transformers is a state-of-the-art machine learning for pytorch, tensorflow and JAX. using this pretrained model you can reduce your computer cost and time. You can implement from scratch. this library can offer various tasks in NLP. such as..  
- text classification  
- information extraction
- question answering
- summarization
- translation
- text generation  
  

transformers supports seamless integration between tensorflow, pytorch and JAX.
